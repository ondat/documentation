# README

For anyone working on the UX/UI on this repo, the doc search is still being
implemented. The \_category\_.yml file in each subdirectory of docs/ is to
ensure that the side bar renders properly. The pages in the versioned\_docs/
folder are pre-built static html files, and won't render properly in docusaurus
yet, so I've deactivated them. If you want to try to work with them just remove
the underscore from underneath the \_versioned\_docs/ and \_versions.json files

This repository contains the Ondat Markdown documentation content published [here](https://docs.ondat.io).
The documentation is readable directly out of this repository without needing any extra rendering steps.

The `main` branch is the _latest_ version of the documentation and is automatically pushed to <https://docs.ondat.io>.

## Docusaurus Engine Readme
## How to run these docs locally.

This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern 
static website generator.

### Installation

```

$ yarn

```

### Local Development

```

$ yarn start

```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window.
Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```

$ yarn build

```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be 
served using any static contents hosting service.

### Deployment

```

$ GIT_USER=<Your GitHub username> USE_SSH=true yarn deploy

```

If you are using GitHub pages for hosting, this command is a convenient way to build the website and push to the `gh-pages` branch.
