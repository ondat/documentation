Ondat implements a `MutatingAdmissionWebhook` [Admission
Controller](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/extensible-admission-controllers/#what-are-admission-webhooks)
to ensure that Pods using Ondat Volumes use the [storageos-scheduler](/docs/reference/scheduler/). An admission controller intercepts
requests to the Kubernetes API server prior to persistence of the object, but
after the request is authenticated and authorized.

The Admission Controller is responsible for mutating the PodSpec at creation time
to populate the `PodSpec.schedulerName` field with the name of the Ondat
Scheduler - `storageos-scheduler`.

During Pod creation, Kubernetes sends a web request to the Ondat
WebHook with the Pod specification. The PodSpec is only altered to use the
Ondat scheduler if the Pod uses an Ondat volume.

## Web Server

The Web Server hosting the web hook is executed in the Ondat Cluster
Operator. Since only HTTPS requests are allowed, the Operator generates a
self-signed x509 certificate every time it starts. The Cluster Operator will
also renew certificates upon expiry (certs are valid for one year).

There is no manual intervention required regarding the SSL configuration as the
setup is completely transparent between Ondat and Kubernetes.

## Skipping Mutation

To avoid scheduler mutation, the `storageos.com/scheduler=false` annotation can
be added to resources that use Ondat volumes.

When using StatefulSets the annotation can be set on the `spec.template.metadata.annotations` field.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: StatefulSet
spec:
  ...
  template:
    metadata:
      annotations:
        storageos.com/scheduler: "false" # N.B. the value must be a string and not a boolean
```

When using Pods the annotation is set on the `metadata.annotations` field.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
    ...
    annotations:
        storageos.com/scheduler: "false" # N.B. the value must be a string and not a boolean
    ...
```

## Explicit SchedulerName

> ðŸ’¡ It is not necessary to explicitly set the SchedulerName as the [Admission

> Admission Controller.

Kubernetes allows the use of different schedulers by setting the field
`.spec.schedulerName: storageos-scheduler`.

For instance a Pod manifest utilising the Ondat scheduler would appear as follows:

```bash
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: d1
spec:
  schedulerName: storageos-scheduler # --> Ondat Scheduler
                                     # No need if using Admission Controller
                                     # (enabled by default)
  containers:
    - name: debian
      image: debian:9-slim
      command: ["/bin/sleep"]
      args: [ "3600" ]
      volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: /mnt
          name: v1
  volumes:
    - name: v1
      persistentVolumeClaim:
        claimName: persistent-volume # ----> Ondat PVC

```

## Compatibility

The Admission Controller doesn't need to be enabled at Kubernetes cluster
bootstrap time because it is a `Dynamic Admission Controller`. Hence, any
cluster that has the `MutatingAdmissionWebhook` enabled is supported. Most
Kubernetes cluster enable the Webhook admission controller by default.

The
[MutatingAdmissionWebhook](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/admission-controllers/#mutatingadmissionwebhook)
is available from Kubernetes v1.13.

You can check your Kubernetes cluster compatibility by checking if the
following object exists.

```bash
kubectl api-versions | grep admissionregistration.k8s.io
```
