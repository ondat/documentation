# Prerequisites for using Ondat

## Minimum requirements

One machine with the following:

* Minimum two core with 4GB RAM
* Linux with a 64-bit architecture
* Kubernetes 1.21, 1.22, 1.23, 1.24 and 1.25
* OpenShift 4.8, 4.9, 4.10. 4.11 and 4.12
* Container Runtime Engine: CRI-O, Containerd or Docker 1.10+ with [mount propagation](/docs/prerequisites/mountpropagation) enabled
* The necessary ports should be open. See the [ports and firewall settings](/docs/prerequisites/firewalls)
* [Etcd cluster](/docs/prerequisites/etcd) for Ondat
* A mechanism for [device presentation](/docs/prerequisites/systemconfiguration)

## Recommended

* Prepare a cluster with minimum of 5 nodes when running etcd within Kubernetes for replication and high availability; 3 nodes if etcd is outside Kubernetes or a self-eval cluster
* [Install the Ondat CLI](/docs/reference/cli/)
* If using Helm2, make sure the tiller ServiceAccount has enough privileges to create resources such as Namespaces, ClusterRoles, etc. For instance, following this [installation procedure](https://v2.helm.sh/docs/using_helm/#role-based-access-control)
* System clocks synchronized using NTP or similar methods. While our distributed consensus algorithm does not require synchronised clocks, it does help to more easily correlate logs across multiple nodes
* A PID cgroup limit of 32768
* Some aspects of product operation require kernel support for IPv6. See the [IPv6 prequisites](/docs/prerequisites/ipv6) page
