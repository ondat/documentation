Ondat requires an etcd cluster in order to function. For more information on
why etcd is required, see our [etcd concepts](/docs/concepts/etcd) page.

Neither Ondat nor Kubernetes support using Kubernetes' own internal etcd for Ondat.

For most use-cases it is recommended to install the Ondat etcd operator that
will manage creation and maintenance of Ondat's required etcd cluster. In some
circumstances, eg. when cloud storage technologies are not available,
it makes sense to install etcd on separate machines outside of
your Kubernetes cluster.

## Installing Etcd Into Your Kubernetes Cluster

This is our recommended way to host etcd in both testing and production
environments.

## Configuring Storage for Etcd

We highly recommend using cloud provider network attached disks for storing
etcd data, such as EBS volumes, Google Persistent Disks, Azure Disks, etc. This
allows the etcd operator to recover from node failures.

For testing environments or where there are no resilient storage options available,
a node-local storage option can be used, such as
[Local Path Provisioner](https://github.com/rancher/local-path-provisioner).
This will store etcd data on the node hosting an etcd pod

> ⚠️ The `local-path` StorageClass is only recommended when other, better
> storage classes are not available, as this stores
> all the data of the `etcd` peers locally, which
> makes it susceptible to state being lost on node failures.
> In the case of `local-path` storage, a minimum of 5 etcd nodes
> is recommended to increase resilience.

## Installing Etcd

An etcd cluster can be created in three different ways:

* Installing the etcd operator via our helm chart
* Installing Ondat (and the etcd operator) via our Plugin
* Manually deploying the etcd operator and applying an `etcdcluster` custom resource

### **Recommended:** Installing the etcd operator via our helm chart

For full instructions, visit [Ondat Helm
Chart](https://github.com/ondat/charts) repository.

### **Recommended:** Installing Ondat (and the etcd operator) via our Plugin

```
kubectl storageos install \
    --include-etcd \
    --etcd-storage-class <the storage class you want to use for etcd> \
    --etcd-tls-enabled
```

### **Configurable:** Manually applying an `etcdcluster` custom resource

This installation method allows the most configuration of the etcd cluster, but
is error-prone and therefore not recommended in situations in which the Helm chart
or plugin can be used, instead.

* Manually applying an `etcdcluster` custom resource

### Recommended: Installing the etcd operator via our helm chart

```
kubectl storageos install \
    --include-etcd \
    --etcd-storage-class <the storage class you want to use for etcd> \
    --etcd-tls-enabled
```

### Manually applying an `etcdcluster` custom resource

This installation method allows the most configuration of the etcd cluster, but
is error-prone and therefore not recommended in situations in which the Helm chart
or plugin can be used, instead.

Find the verison of the etcd operator you want to install from
[GitHub](https://github.com/storageos/etcd-cluster-operator/releases/).

Install the etcd operator:

```
export ETCD_OPERATOR_VERSION=<set the version you want to use>
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/storageos/etcd-cluster-operator/releases/download/${ETCD_OPERATOR_VERSION}/storageos-etcd-cluster-operator.yaml
```

Then adapt the following sample to your needs and use `kubectl` to  apply it:

```
export ETCD_OPERATOR_VERSION=<set the version you want to use>
wget https://github.com/storageos/etcd-cluster-operator/releases/download/${ETCD_OPERATOR_VERSION}/storageos-etcd-cluster.yaml
vim storageos-etcd-cluster.yaml
kubectl apply -f storageos-etcd-cluster.yaml
```

### Installation Verification
