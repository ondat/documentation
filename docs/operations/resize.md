Ondat supports both online (version >= v2.9.0) and offline resizing of volumes,
either through editing a PVC storage request, or by updating the volume config
via the CLI or UI.  Online resizing is not supported for RWX volumes.

Note, that Ondat only supports increasing volume size. For more
information on how the resize works, see our [Resize Concepts](/docs/concepts/volumes#volume-resize) page.

### Before Resizing a Volume

Before resizing a volume, ensure that the licence you have supports the storage
size that will be requested as storage request sizes cannot be lowered.

### Resizing a Volume - Online

From Ondat v2.9.0 online volume resizing is supported for XFS and ext4 filesystems.
In order to resize a PVC the storage request field must be updated.

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: pvc-1
spec:
  storageClassName: storageos
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 5Gi
```

In order to edit a PVC you can use `kubectl edit` or `kubectl apply` to make
changes.

> ⚠️ Resizing a volume without updating the PVC directly will NOT result in
> the PVC being updated. The methods below are included for completeness. In
> Kubernetes environments editing the PVC is the preferred method for resizing
> a volume.

To resize a volume using the Ondat CLI use the `volume update` command

```bash
$ storageos update volume size pvc-a47cfa03-cc92-4ec9-84ab-00e5516c64fa 10GiB
Name:                                 pvc-a47cfa03-cc92-4ec9-84ab-00e5516c64fa

```

To resize a volume using the Ondat UI, navigate to the volumes section and
click the edit pencil in order to update the volume config.

### Resizing a Volume - Offline

For Ondat versions older than v2.9.0 a volume must be offline before
it can be resized. Therefore, before performing the operation, scale
down any pods using the volume. This will ensure that it is not in use.

The same methods of resizing the volume as used for online volume resizing
can also be used for offline volume resizing.
