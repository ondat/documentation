## Best practices - Etcd Inside the Cluster

This page describe best practices when hosting etcd **inside** Kubernetes using Ondat's etcd operator. Best practices when hosting etcd **outside** Kubernetes can be found [here](/docs/operations/etcd/etcd-outside-k8s/_index.md)

Ondat uses etcd as a service, whether it is deployed following the
[step by step](/docs/prerequisites/etcd) instructions or as a custom
installation.  
The etcd operator will maintain availability and integrity of the etcd cluster, however it is recommended to monitor etcd metrics to ensure the cluster is functioning as expected.

It is highly recommended to keep the cluster backed up and ensure high
availability of its data.

### Network low latency

It is important to keep the latency between Ondat nodes and the etcd
replicas low. Deploying an etcd cluster in a different data center or region
can make Ondat detect etcd nodes as unavailable due to latency. 10ms
latency between Ondat and etcd would be the maximum threshold for proper
functioning of the system.

### Disk low latency

Etcd is very sensitive to disk latency. Because of that, it is recommended to
run etcd away from other IO-intensive workloads. Operations such as backups,
builds or application bundling cause a heavy usage of disks. If such
operations run alongside the etcd nodes, they will cause etcd to become
unstable and suffer downtime. It is best to run etcd nodes isolated from other
IO workloads.

### IOPS requirements

As a general rule, for etcd to operate normally on production clusters, we
recommend using the size of machine offered by your cloud provider that
guarantees a minimum of 500 IOPS. For example, 750 baseline IOPS are
guaranteed on a 250GB AWS gp2 EBS instance at time of writing, and block
instances on other cloud providers will also specify baseline IOPS figures.

Cloud providers usually provide "bursts" of IOPS - temporarily higher rates,
limited by credits - with larger volumes providing higher burst capacity. If
you are relying on burst capacity for etcd, which requires sustained high
performance, careful assessment is necessary to ensure sufficient capacity.

The rate of etcd operations is affected by the number of nodes, volumes and
replicas in the cluster, therefore the figure of 500 is provided as a
guideline only. A development cluster with 5 nodes will not have the same etcd
traffic as a production cluster with 100 nodes. Adding [monitoring](/docs/operations/etcd/) to etcd will help to
characterise the traffic, and therefore to assess the individual requirements
of a cluster and adjust its resources accordingly.

### Monitoring

It is highly recommended to add monitoring to the etcd cluster.
When using the Ondat etcd operator etcd serves
Prometheus metrics on a separate metrics port `http://storageos-etcd.storageos-etcd:2381/metrics`.

You can use Ondat developed Grafana Dashboards for etcd. When using etcd
for production, you can use the
[etcd-cluster-as-service](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/10322), while
the [etcd-cluster-as-pod](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/10323) can be
used when using etcd from the operator.

### Defragmentation

Etcd uses revisions to store multiple versions of keys. Compaction removes all
key revision prior to a certain revision from etcd. Typically the etcd
configuration enables the automatic compaction of keys to prevent performance
degradation and limit the storage required. Compaction of revisions can create
fragmentation that means space on disk is available for use by etcd but is
unavailable for use by the file system. In order to reclaim this space, etcd
can be defragmented.

Reclaiming space is important because when the etcd database file grows over
the "DB_BACKEND_BYTES" parameter, the cluster triggers an alarm and sets
itself read only and only allows reads and deletes. To avoid hitting the db
backend bytes limit, compaction and defragmentation are required. How often
defragmentation is required depends on the churn of key revisions in etcd.

Be aware that defragmentation is a blocking operation that is
performed per node, hence the etcd node will be locked for the duration of the
defragmentation. Defragmentation usually takes a few milliseconds to complete.

The etcd operator will automatically defrag the etcd cluster when it reaches 80% used space or every hour.
It will never defrag more than one etcd peer at once, so etcd will remain available.
