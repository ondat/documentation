  How to ask for Ondat support.
---

When you need support, raise a ticket via our [Help Desk
portal](https://support.ondat.io/).

It is important to select the priority of your ticket in accordance with the severity. This helps us to route and prioritise your ticket accordingly.

Responses to tickets will be cc'd via email.

For personal support and general enquiries, join our [public Slack channel](https://slack.ondat.com).

### Ondat Support Bundle

Ondat provides the ability to generate a support bundle that aggregates cluster information. See [Support Bundle](/docs/reference/bundles/support_bundle) for a list of what is included.

Ondat engineers might ask for a support bundle to be generated during support cases.

The information in the bundle is used only for support purposes, and will be removed once it is no longer needed. If the information is sensitive and can't be given to Ondat, make sure that the support engineers have as much information about your environment as possible.

Refer to the [Support Bundle](/docs/reference/bundles/support_bundle) documentation page for details of how to generate a bundle.
