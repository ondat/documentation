We are always looking to improve our documentation. If you like to help people
and can write, read on for the process for submitting your contributions. If your
guide is published, you'll receive $250 per article by PayPal.

## Content guidelines

A guide contains step by step instructions for how to accomplish a specific
task using Ondat. To be accepted, guides must be:

* Written in English.
* Relevant, accurate and complete.
* Technically correct and thoroughly tested.

Guides should avoid:

* Duplicating an existing guide or other sources, such as blogs or forum posts.
* Including irrelevant material.

## Submission and review

You should submit your guide as a pull request to
[the GitHub repository](https://github.com/ondat/documentation.git).

Your submission will be left open for community review for two weeks. After
this, your submission will be reviewed internally for about another week.

If accepted, your pull request will be approved and you will have 36 hours to
send your submission title and PayPal account information. Non-response will be
taken as a go-ahead to publish.
