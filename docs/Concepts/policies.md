Ondat policies are a way to control user and group access to Ondat
[Namespaces](/docs/concepts/namespaces). To grant a user or group
access to a namespace, a policy needs to be created mapping the user or group
to the namespace.

> ðŸ’¡ Users always have access to the default namespace

For more information on how to use policies, see the
[Policies operations](/docs/operations/policies) page.
